## Configuring Celery with Redis for sending OTP to your email

To configure Celery with Redis for sending OTP to your email, follow these steps:

1. **Install and Set Up Redis:**

   - For Windows:
     - Download the Redis for Windows executable from the GitHub repository: [https://github.com/microsoftarchive/redis/releases](https://github.com/microsoftarchive/redis/releases)
     - Download Redis-x64-3.0.504.msi and connect to port 6379

   - For Other Operating Systems:
     - Follow the official Redis installation guide for your operating system: [https://redis.io/download](https://redis.io/download)
   

2. **Install Celery And Redis:**
- In your project's virtual environment, install Celery and Redis using pip:
  ```
  pip install celery
  pip install redis
  ```

### Changing Email and Password for Sending Emails

1. **Access Django Project Settings:**
   Open your Django project's `settings.py` file. This file contains all the configuration settings for your project.

2. **Locate Email Configuration:**
   Find the section in your `settings.py` file where the email configuration settings are defined. 

   ```python
   # Configuration for sending emails
   EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
   EMAIL_HOST = "smtp.gmail.com"
   EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
   EMAIL_PORT = 587
   EMAIL_HOST_USER = "your_email@example.com"
   EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = "your_app_password"


3. **Change Email Address:**
   Replace `"your_email@example.com"` with the new Gmail email address you want to use for sending emails.

4. **Change App Password:**
   Replace `"your_app_password"` with the new app-specific password generated by Gmail for your account. If you haven't generated an app password before, you can follow these steps to create one:

   - Go to your Google Account settings: [https://myaccount.google.com/](https://myaccount.google.com/)
   - Under the "Security" section, locate the "App passwords" option.
   - Generate a new app password for your Django project. Select "Other (Custom name)" as the app and provide a name like "Django Email App."
   - Google will generate a unique app-specific password for your project. Use this password in the `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` field.

5. **Save Changes:**
   After updating the email configuration settings, save the changes to your `settings.py` file.


6. **Create and Run Celery Worker:**
   - Open another terminal window and navigate to your project's directory.
   - Run the Celery worker:
     ```
     celery -A config worker -l info
     ```



## Deploying a Django Backend Application and Configuring Static Files on PythonAnywhere


1. **Log In/Create Account:**
   - If you don't have a PythonAnywhere account, sign up for one at [https://www.pythonanywhere.com/registration/register/beginner/](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/registration/register/beginner/).

2. **Create a Web App:**
   - After logging in, navigate to the Dashboard.
   - Click on "Web" to create a new web app.
   - Choose "Manual Configuration" and select the appropriate Python version.

3. **Clone Your Repository:**
   - From your Dashboard, navigate to the "Console" section.
   - Clone your backend application's repository using Git Bash:
     ```
     git clone [repository_url]
     ```

4. **Set Up Virtual Environment:**
   - In the terminal, navigate to your project directory:
     ```
     cd [project_directory]
     ```
   - Create a virtual environment:
     ```
     virtualenv venv --python=python3.8
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

5. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Install the required dependencies for your backend application using pip:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

6. **Configure WSGI File:**
   - Navigate to the "Web" section of PythonAnywhere.
   - Edit the WSGI configuration file and specify the path to your application's WSGI file.

7. **Configure Static Files:**
   - Scroll down to the "Static files" section.
   - Specify the URL path and directory of your static files.
   - In the terminal run the following command:
     ```
     python manage.py collectstatic
     ```

8. **Database Configuration:**
   - No need, because we are using Django's default DB

9. **Restart Web App:**
   - Go back to the "Web" section and click the "Reload" button to apply your changes.
   - Your deployed backend application should be live on the provided URL.

10. **Monitor and Debug:**
    - Check the "Errors" and "Server Logs" sections on PythonAnywhere for any issues or errors.
    - Test your deployed backend application to ensure it functions as expected.

By following these steps, you'll successfully deploy your Django backend application on PythonAnywhere and configure static file mappings.
